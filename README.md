# Project Title

Pokemon SwiftUI app for 3 Sided Cube iOS Recruitment task

## Description

This is a very simple SwiftUI app with 2 screens:
* A searchable list of pokemons
* A detailed screen when a given pokemon is selected from the list.

I have experience developing with UIKit but I am new to SwiftUI. So a lot of what is in there is a bit rough. But I have learned a lot in a few days and I will continue to use this task to improve my understanding of SwiftUI, Async/Await, good code structure for SwiftUI apps and better testing of asynchronous functions.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

I have only used 1 dependency in this app using SwiftPackageManager:
* https://github.com/johnsundell/collectionconcurrencykit by John Sundell.

### Installing

You can get the code here: https://github.com/Litome/Pokemon

### Executing program

Open Pokemon.xcodeproj in xCode
Select a target device (iPhone or iPad)
then either:
* `U+2318` + R to build and run on target device
* `U+2318` + U to run the unit tests

## Help

I am still at the start of my journey to learn SwiftUI but I would be happy to discuss the different construct I have chosen to use so far and why.
